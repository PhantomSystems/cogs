the social media cogs for the astrobot. Open source because like, they are cool yano?

these are written in python in cog format as that allows them to be loaded and unloaded if we see they are causing stability issues in other parts of the bot.

contributions are welcome, see [CONTRIBUTING]. we use mergify to protect our PRs.
